# Javascript Quiz (Homework 4)

This project is a javascript quiz. The user has a 90 second time limit to answer 5 questions about javascript. If they answer a question incorrectly then they are penalized by 10 seconds on the time limit. The user only has one chance to answer each question. If they get it correct then they move on to the next question. If they answer incorrectly then they lose 10 seconds off of the timer and move on to the next question. At the end of the quiz their score is presented and they enter their initials. After submitting their initials they are taken to the high score page. The high score page is sorted with the highest score first, along with the initials of that person.
